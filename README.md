# MANGAClean
MANGAClean uses the PyTorch implementation of the pix2pix GAN network, forked from [pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) to convert raw dirty scans of manga pages into high-quality, denoised images:

The goal of this project was to effectively automate the cleaning process in manga scanlation procedures. But before moving on, here is some background information on what 'scanlation' and what 'manga cleaning' entails: 

## Background
From Wikipedia, **scanlation** is the fan-made scanning, translation, and editing of comics from one language into another. While this is not limited only to manga (Japanese comics), my personal experiences have only been with scanlating manga, so this project has only been trained/tested with manga pages. 

A typical scanlation process has several roles/jobs, but the one we're concerned with is the job of the cleaner. So what exactly does a 'cleaner' do?

First, the cleaner will get the 'raws', which are scans or pictures of the print form of the original content. The quality of the raws differ quite a bit. The job of the cleaner then, is to edit the raws so that the finished products look like officially published online volumes. Below are some examples of raw vs. clean manga pages:

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started
### Installation

- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
```

- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org and) 0.4+ and other dependencies (e.g., torchvision, [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) and [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)).
  - For pip users, please type the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - For Conda users, we provide a installation script `./scripts/conda_deps.sh`. Alternatively, you can create a new Conda environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
  - For Docker users, we provide the pre-built Docker image and Dockerfile. Please refer to our [Docker](docs/docker.md) page.




### pix2pix train/test
- Download a pix2pix dataset (e.g.[facades](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/)):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. 
- Train a model:
```bash
#!./scripts/train_pix2pix.sh
python train.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/facades_pix2pix/web/index.html`.

- Test the model (`bash ./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh`):
```bash
#!./scripts/test_pix2pix.sh
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades --name facades_pix2pix --model pix2pix --direction BtoA
```
- The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/facades_pix2pix/test_latest/index.html`. You can find more scripts at `scripts` directory.
- To train and test pix2pix-based colorization models, please add `--model colorization` and `--dataset_mode colorization`. See our training [tips](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/docs/tips.md#notes-on-colorization) for more details.

### Apply a pre-trained model (pix2pix)
Download a pre-trained model with `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`.

- Check [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh#L3) for all the available pix2pix models. For example, if you would like to download label2photo model on the Facades dataset,
```bash
bash ./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh facades_label2photo
```
- Download the pix2pix facades datasets:
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_pix2pix_dataset.sh facades
```
- Then generate the results using
```bash
python test.py --dataroot ./datasets/facades/ --direction BtoA --model pix2pix --name facades_label2photo_pretrained
```
- Note that we specified `--direction BtoA` as Facades dataset's A to B direction is photos to labels.

- If you would like to apply a pre-trained model to a collection of input images (rather than image pairs), please use `--model test` option. See `./scripts/test_single.sh` for how to apply a model to Facade label maps (stored in the directory `facades/testB`).

- See a list of currently available models at `./scripts/download_pix2pix_model.sh`
